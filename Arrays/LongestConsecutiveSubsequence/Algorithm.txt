Method-1 O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

1. Sort the array
2. Assign count and temp to 1
3. Start iterating the array from 1st index, 
    a. if arr[i]==arr[i-1]+1, then it is consecutive, so increment the count
    b. else, if temp is greater than count, reassign count to temp, and assign temp to 1, since we have to start fresh
4. Return the count

Method-2 O(n) time and O(n) space

1. Store all the elements of the array in an hashset
2. Iterate the array, if the set doesnt contain arr[i]-1, it means it's the starting element of the consecutive sequence
3. Run the loop from arr[i], until it is contained in the set.
4. Keep the trace of temp, and reassign it to count whenever temp is greater than count.
