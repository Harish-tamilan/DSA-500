Method-1 O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

1. Sort the given intervals (arr) based on their starting time
2. Assign start and end to first meeting's start and end time
3. Start traversing the array from 1st index, if the start time of current meeting is 
    less than the end variable, it means that it should get merged.
4. If the current meeting arr[i]'s end time is greater than end variable, reassign the
    end variable to current meeting arr[i]'s end time.
5. Else push the start and end variable to an array, and push that array to resultant
    variable "intervals", reassign start and end to current meeting arr[i]'s start
    and end time, arr[start] and arr[end].
