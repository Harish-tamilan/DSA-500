Algorithm

1. Use a sliding window to find the range in which the zeroes can be flipped
2. Initialize left and right to 0, assign temp = m
3. Run a loop till right < n ( n = length of the array)
4. If arr[right]==0, decrement temp.
5. During each iteration, check whether temp<0 ( m zeroes has been changed to ones), if so move the left pointer
until it encounters next zero, move the left pointer to next index and increment temp.
6. Move the right pointer if temp>=0. And check whether the length of the sliding window (right - left) is greater
than the existing count (max), if so reassign max, l, r.
