Method-1 O(n)-time and O(1)-space

1. Assign temp and sum to arr[0]
2. Iterate the array from 1st index, 
    a. if the sum of arr[i] and temp is less than 0, then there is no point of carrying the negative 
    sum forward, so we reassign temp to 0, if arr[i] is greater than sum, reassign sum to arr[i].
    b. else add arr[i] to temp, if temp is greater than sum, reassign sum to temp.
