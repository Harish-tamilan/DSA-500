Method-1 O(n) time (where n is the length of longest array)

1. Assign i and j to 0
2. Run a loop such that i<array1.length and j< array2.length
3. Run two loops again, in order to move i and j to the last poisition if the 
    duplicates are present
    (i.e array1=2,2,2,2,4,5 and array2=2,2,2,6 in this case i should be moved to 3rd index
    and j should be moved to 2nd index) 
4. Now if array1[i]==array2[j] add either to list, and increment both i and j
5. Else if array[i]>array2[j] increment j
6. Else increment i
