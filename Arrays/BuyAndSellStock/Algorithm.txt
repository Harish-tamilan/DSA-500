Method-1 O(n^2) time

1. Use two nested loops
2. Try buying and selling on all (i,j) days
3. Keep the trace of the maximum

Method-2 O(n)-time

1. Assign the i as arr[0]
2. Start iterating the array from 1st index, if the number is less than arr[j], reassign the i, else find the difference and keep trace of the max
