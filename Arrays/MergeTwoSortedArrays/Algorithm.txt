1. Iterate through both the arrays, try to place the larger elements in second array and smaller elements in first array
2. Initialize i = 0, j = 0, k = arr1.length-1
3. Run a loop till (i<=k && j<arr2.length)
4. During each iteration check if arr[i]>arr[j], if so swap the greatest element in arr1 (arr[k]) with arr2[j]
and increment j, decrement k.
5. Else move i towards right (i++)
