Method-1 O(n) time and O(1) space

1. Assign n to length of the input string, i=0, j=n-1
2. Start iterating the array until i<j
3. During each iteration check whether character at ith index and jth index of the
    string are same, else return false
4. Increment i by 1 and decrement j by 1
5. Return true after the loop
