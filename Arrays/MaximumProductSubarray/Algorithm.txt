Method-1 O(n^2) time and O(1) space

1. Run two nested loops.
2. Find the product between all (i,j) and store it in temp.
3. If temp is greater than max, reassign max to temp

Method-2 O(n) time and O(1) space

1. Assign two variables min and max
2. Iterate the array from 1st index, multiply current with minimum and maximum
    and store it to temp1 and temp2.
    (i.e if min is -180, max is 60 multiply min with negative gives us a greater value,
    that is why we need to keep track of min)
3. Reassign min, max with by comparing them with temp1, temp2 and arr[i]
4. If max is greater than product reassign product with max
