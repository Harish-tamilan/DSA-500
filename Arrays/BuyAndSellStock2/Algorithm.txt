Method-1 O(n)-time and O(n)-space

1. Create an array named profit.
2. Traverse the input array from the end
3. Fill the profit array with profit by buying and selling a stock once
    (i.e Assign the maximum as arr[n-1], fill the max of((difference maximum-arr[i]), arr[i+1]) as profit[i], if arr[i]>max, reassign max )
4. Again start iterating from the beginning, now do the same
    (i.e Instead of tracing the max, trace the min, find the difference, compare with profit[i-1] and add to profit[i])

Method-2 O(n)-time and O(1)-space

1. Create four variables, firstBuy, firstSell, secondBuy, secondSell
2. Simulate the above approach using these four variables
