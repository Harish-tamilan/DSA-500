Method-1 O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the length of longest array

1. Maintain an HashMap to keep the count of each element present in all the 
    three arrays.
2. Iterate the HashMap and if the count of a number is three, add that number to the 
    result list



Method-2 O(n) time, where n is the length of longest array

1. Follow the first 3 steps in Intersection of two arrays
2. Now, if array1[i]<array2[j] increment i
3. Else if array2[j]<array3[k] increment j
4. Else increment k
