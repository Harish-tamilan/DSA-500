Method-1 O(nlogn) time, O(p) space (where p denotes the number of platforms)

1. Sort the trains based on their departure time so that we can greedily select
    the train which leaves early first.
2. Create an array with no of platforms as size.
3. Iterate the array and check whether the platform array has a train by 
    comparing the start time of current train and the departure time of 
    existing train.
4. If the departure time is select, it means that the train has left,
    so we can stop the train here.
