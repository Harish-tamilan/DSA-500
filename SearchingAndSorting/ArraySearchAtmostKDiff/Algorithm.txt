Method-1 O(n)-time

1. Use the linear search approach.
2. Iterate the array and if an element is found return it else return -1.

Method-2 Worst case O(n), but in most cases it will be less than O(n)

1. Since the elements differ by atmost k, it can be used to reduce the iterations.
2. Instead of comparing all the elements, iterate to the next ((k/target-)current) element.
