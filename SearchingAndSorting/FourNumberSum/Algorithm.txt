Method-1 O(n^4) time and O(n^2) space (Since we have to return the result, for just finding O(1) space)

1. Run four nested loops, in order to trace all the possible 4 number combinations
2. If the sum of four numbers is equal to target, store it in the result array.
3. Return the result array.


Method-1 O(n^3) time and O(n^2) space (Since we have to return the result, for just finding O(1) space)

1. This solution is the extension of three number sum
2. Sort the array
3. Run two nested loops, we get i,j at all possible positions
4. Run a while loop from k=j+1 to l=n-1
5. Increment k if sum of four is less than target
6. Decrement l if sum of four is greater than target
7. If sum of four == target, store it in the result array, decrement l and increment k
8. Return the result array
